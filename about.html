                        <p>
                            During my years as a high school student, Tic Tac Toe was one of the games that carried a great deal of memories for me. During a freetime or break time, my friends and I at high school would often grab a pen and paper and would start playing tic tac toe until the class starts. However as time passes on, I came to realize that playing tic tac toe on paper is not efficient at all as it causes an increase of useless paper waste. According to EcoBali, a person in Indonesia can waste up to 27 kg of paper each year, and paper wastes account for 28% of landfill waste. So with this Tic Tac Time app, students hopefully will be able to significantly reduce paper wastes by shifting towards a more digital approach.

                            In Tic Tac Time, two players would go against each other to fight for victory. The rules are pretty straightforward. Each player will be assigned a symbol each, either cross or circle, depending on who will play as the first player or the second player. At the beginning of the game, players will be presented with 9 empty grids (3x3 grid). As the game begins, players will need to try their best to connect 3 grids with their assigned symbols. The winner will be decided by the player who is able to connect 3 grids first.
